# Livestream Integration Example

This folder contains an example for integrating the Theta mesh network player into a livestreaming site. To run this demo, simply download this repository, and double click on the index.hmtl page in this folder. As shown in the screenshot below, the page should contain the Theta player and a traffic composition chart, which displays the amount of data transferred to/from peer nodes with different colors. The page also shows the Gamma token earned for bandwith sharing. You can open the index.html page on multiple browser tabs to see the bandwidth sharing in action.
