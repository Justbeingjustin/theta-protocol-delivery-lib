# Theta Mesh Delivery Protocol

The Theta Mesh Delivery Protocol handles bandwidth sharing. Initially it is implemented as a lightweight JavaScript library built on top of WebRTC. It can be integrated into web pages with minimal effort, and enables instant browser-to-browser stream data sharing among viewers. Advanced geolocation and connectivity history based peer grouping algorithms have been designed to maximize peer offload with guaranteed delivery QoS.

This repository contains the packaged JavaScript client library along with integration examples.
